The use of the generic masculine in terms such as "printer" or "artist" is inclusive of all genders.

Some illustrations, including depictions of regional and national specifics in the history of dress and customs, portray stereotypes and use labels such as "Indian" or "African". This is particularly noticeable in early modern costume books: their structure is strongly hierarchical; regions and nations are defined by clothing and nudity.
