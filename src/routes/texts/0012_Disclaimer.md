On gender: The descriptions in this database, which addresses all persons (m/f/d) equally, are written in the generic masculine. e.g. "Drucker" (printmaker), "Maler" painter etc. means all persons equally.

Content Warning: Some illustrations, including depictions of regional and national specifics in the history of dress and customs, portray stereotypes and use labels such as "Indian" or "African". This is particularly noticeable in early modern costume books: their structure is strongly hierarchical; regions and nations are defined by clothing and nudity.
