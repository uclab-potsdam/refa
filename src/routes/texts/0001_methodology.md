Dress research is still an evolving discipline. While dress, reflecting a wide array of aspects in relation to identity and cultural background, has already become an object of collecting since the middle of the 19th century, dress studies have only gradually come to be viewed as a relevant subject of research. Dress research is concerned with the academic study of fashion, style, dress, and textile, its history and symbolism. Its methods are drawing from the fields of visual studies, linguistics, and cultural studies, while a detailed empirical analysis and interpretation of the material is done by textile researchers and conservators. Fashion in images (painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture) and in written works is typically considered through the lens of art history, cultural studies, design studies, economics, history, literature, semiotics, and sociology, whereas the research on textiles and clothing tends to favor technology-based methods of investigation. Because fashion is addressed by different conceptual frameworks and disciplinary approaches, some scholars refer to it as a “hybrid subject” or a “mixed method approach”. 
Restaging Fashion draws on visual, documentary, and material evidence, sources that are connected and communicated through the means of information visualization.
