The interdisciplinary research and digitization project RESTAGING FASHION elaborates new perspectives on historical dress. Thereby this research unites approaches and desiderata from three research areas: Art history (dress research), information sciences (digital knowledge organization) and computer science (data visualization). Dedicated to the cultural history of clothing, its visual appearance, and symbolic character the project juxtaposes the triad of the sources image-text-dress as an approach to dress research that integrates multiple methods. The project brings together items from the collection Modebild - Lipperheidesche Kost√ºmbibliothek of the Berlin Art Library with historic garments from the Textiles, Clothing and Jewellery Collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg.
