The interdisciplinary research and digitization project RESTAGING FASHION elaborates new perspectives on historical dress. This research unites approaches and desiderata from three disciplines and respective research areas: Art history (dress research), information science (knowledge organization) and information visualization. Dedicated to the cultural history of clothing, its visual appearance, and its symbolic character, the project juxtaposes the triad of image-text-dress as an approach to dress research that integrates multiple methods. The project brings together items from the collection Lipperheidesche Kost√ºmbibliothek - Sammlung Modebild of the Berlin Art Library with historic garments from the Textiles, Clothing and Jewellery Collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg.
