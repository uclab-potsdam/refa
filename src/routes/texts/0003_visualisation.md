Data visualization projects are often initiated on the basis of an existing dataset, which may need to be prepared and analyzed before being visualized. In contrast, this research project provided for a parallel and interconnected process of data modeling and creation, closely coupled with the design and prototyping of visualizations. Since the beginning of the project, several prototypes and experiments, in the form of [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@sinanatra/refa), have been made, in order to test the appropriate representation of the information and insights produced during the research.
