The visualization research centered on the visual juxtaposition and interactive coupling of essays and graph visualizations. The intention was to represent the art historical discourse in close connection with access points into the collection. The concept of the ReFa reader allows for the linear perusal of the essays and the lateral exploration of associated artifacts and entities. The [ReFaÂ Reader](https://refareader.fh-potsdam.de/) was designed and deployed as an interactive web application that builds on standards such as Markdown for the formatting and linking of the essays and the Omeka S API for the inclusion of items and entities part of a digitized and cataloged collection. The ReFa Reader is  [made available](https://github.com/sinanatra/refa-reader-template) under an open source license for reuse with other digitized collections.
