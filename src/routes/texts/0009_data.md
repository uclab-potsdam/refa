The data of the Restaging Fashion project has been structured as semantic JSON-LD and it is served through the [Omeka-S API](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api).
To facilitate the download of data and query the database, pre-made Observable Notebooks have been created:

- [Download data](https://observablehq.com/@sinanatra/refa-download-items)    
- [Query triplets](https://observablehq.com/@sinanatra/refa-graph)   
- [Sparql queries](https://observablehq.com/@sinanatra/refa-sparql-queries)    

It is always possible to structure additional queries following this [documentation](https://omeka.org/s/docs/developer/api/), and using the `https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/refa-catalog/api` endpoint.
