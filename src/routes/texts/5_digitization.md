title: Conservation and Digitization

The painting and miniature collection of the publishing couple Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide, which had previously been deposited, was examined within the framework of the project for necessary conservation interventions, stabilized and treated for conservation in individual cases, dusted and digitized. The large-format paintings were captured with a high-performance scanner from the company Kruse. In order to scan the paintings horizontally it was necessary to stabilize the wooden or linen surfaces. They were supported with blocks of foam or rubber for this purpose, also to guarantee a uniform scanning height for the scanner. The objects were illuminated at an angle of 45 degrees. In this way, light refractions caused by the applied varnish could be avoided. A small number of works that could not be transported were photographed in the depot on the grid wall. Prints and drawings were digitized with high resolution in .tiff format.
