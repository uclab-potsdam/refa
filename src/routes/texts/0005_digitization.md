The painting and miniature collection of Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide was examined within the framework of the project for necessary conservation interventions; it was stabilized and treated for conservation in individual cases, as well as dusted and digitized (a,b,c). The large-format paintings were captured with a high-performance scanner from the company Kruse (d). In order to scan the paintings horizontally it was necessary to stabilize the wooden or linen surfaces. They were supported with blocks of foam or rubber for this purpose - also for getting a uniform scanning height for the scanner (e). The objects were illuminated at an angle of 45 degrees. In this way, light refractions caused by the applied varnish could be avoided. A small number of works that could not be transported were photographed on the grid wall in the depot. Prints and drawings were digitized with high resolution and stored in the TIFF format.
