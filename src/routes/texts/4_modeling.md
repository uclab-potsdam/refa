Data curation has been a crucial and challenging part of the project. A significant amount of data, focusing on the documentation of paintings and miniatures of the Lipperheide Collection, was transferred from a pre-existing database to an Omeka instance, thereafter enriched with additional material regarding prints, drawings and 3D scanned garments. The data structure is based on a simplified version of the CIDOC-CRM model, adapted to the needs of documentation and final visualization. Elements from external metadata schemas (Dublin Core, Linked.Art, local schema) have been also used, in order to address project specificities, whereas additional ontologies (SKOS, MADS) and vocabularies (AAT, ICONCLASS, TGN) came into play for describing concepts and named entities.
The end result has been a refined juxtaposition of relationships between items of the collection, their digital representations and any documentation sources, creating a web of linked open data within and outside the framework of the Lipperheide Costume Library and the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg.
