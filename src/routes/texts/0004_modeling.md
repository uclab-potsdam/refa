The [data structure](https://observablehq.com/@sinanatra/refa-graph?collection=@sinanatra/refa) used in the project is based on a simplified version of the CIDOC-CRM model, adapted to the needs of documentation and final visualization. Elements from external schemas and models (Dublin Core, Linked.Art, local schema) have been also used, in order to address project specificities, whereas additional ontologies (SKOS, MADS) and vocabularies (AAT, ICONCLASS, TGN) came into play for describing concepts and named entities.
The initial research data, related to the documentation of paintings and miniatures of the Lipperheide Collection, was enriched and integrated with a set of prints, drawings and garments, all brought together in an instance of Omeka S.
The end result has been a refined set of relationships between collection items, their digital representations and any documentation sources, creating a web of linked open data within and outside the framework of the Lipperheide Costume Library and the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg.
