The publishing couple Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide gathered the collection of paintings and miniatures while traveling in Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland between 1877 and 1882. The Restaging Fashion project conserved, digitized and cataloged the collection in terms of its clothing-historical content and source value. This was supplemented by 1000 selected prints or hand drawings from their collection and later donation to the library. These are understood as both conceptualizing and complementing pictorial sources enriching each other.
Furthermore, a total of fifteen historical clothing items from the Nuremberg textile collection serve as material evidence and are viewable and navigable as 3D objects. Archival documents on the history of the painting and miniature collection situate the collection objects in the historical context of the 19th century and document both the genesis and the division of the collection after the Second World War, as well as its reunification at the Berlin Kulturforum after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In addition, exemplary historical text sources have been selected for completing the source triad of image-text-dress and exemplifying the methodological approach of the project.
