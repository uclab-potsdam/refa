In the context of visualizing data, it often happens to start from a pre-existing data set, which needs to be manipulated and visualized. In contrast, in ReFa's research process, the structure of the data was reasoned simultaneously with its possible visualization. Since the beginning of the project, several prototypes and experiments, in the form of Observable Notebooks [link], have been made to test the proper digitization of information and its potential representation.
Finally, the focus centered on the visual juxtaposition of essays and graph visualizations to better represent the art historical discourse and give access points to navigate the collection. A platform dedicated to it was then designed [link], along with an open access prototype so that it could be reused with other digitized collections [link].
